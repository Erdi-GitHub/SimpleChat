# SimpleChat
A spigot plugin - Simple way of controlling your global chat!

This plugin was created to assist people with controlling their global server chat.

Commands:
/mutechat - Mutes global chat
/clearchat - Clears chat

Permissions:                                   
simplechat.mutechat - Ability to use /mutechat                            
simplechat.clearchat - Ability to use /clearchat                          
simplechat.bypassmutechat - Ability to bypass global chat mute                      

This is my very first plugin. It would be greatly appreciated if you guys, the server admins and owners, were to give me feedback on what I should add.


Keep in mind, I am a 13 year old male who has created this plugin. Just goes to show even "kids" like me can start learning programming languages. Never give up on your dreams.
